## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 Critical (5/5)

| ID | Fix |
|---|---|
| SEC-01 | CSRF protection via `X-Requested-With` + Origin/Referer check on all POST endpoints; header added to all `fetch()` calls in JS |
| SEC-02 | `app.secret_key` set from `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` env var (auto-generates secure random fallback) |
| SEC-06 | `_RateLimiter` applied to `/get-email` (1.5s interval per IP, configurable via env) |
| REL-01 | Startup prefetch guarded behind `if os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY") and os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")` |
| SCALE-01 | Documented single-worker constraint in module docstring |

### 🟠 High (13/13)

| ID | Fix |
|---|---|
| SEC-03 | `uuid.uuid4().hex` for feedback filenames — no more timestamp collisions |
| SEC-04 | `Content-Security-Policy` header added via `set_security_headers()` |
| SEC-05 | `_sanitize_log()` redacts `sk-or-v1-*`, `gsk_*`, `sk-*` key patterns before printing |
| SEC-07 | `email.pop("_model", None)` before `jsonify()` — model name no longer sent to browser |
| SEC-09 | `waitress` installed and auto-selected in `__main__` when not in debug mode; `threaded=True` fallback |
| REL-02 | `_RateLimiter` class with periodic TTL eviction (120s window) — dict never grows unbounded |
| REL-03 | Stale `"GEMINI_API_KEY"` message → `"OPENROUTER_API_KEY and GROQ_API_KEY"` |
| REL-04 | `except Exception` → `except ImportError` on both import guards |
| TEST-01 | Removed `|| true` from CI — test failures now block merges |
| TEST-02 | 25 new unit tests in `tests/test_consensus.py` covering generator waterfall, verifier, consensus loop, fallback, rate limiter, CSRF |
| PERF-01 | `threaded=True` on Flask dev server; waitress handles concurrency in production |
| DEVOPS-01 | Consolidated two CI workflows into one strong `ci.yml` |
| SCALE-02 | UUID filenames prevent filesystem race conditions; documented as future DB migration target |

### 🟡 Medium (12/12)

| ID | Fix |
|---|---|
| SEC-08 | `_strip_html()` strips HTML tags from all AI output as defence-in-depth |
| SEC-09 | `waitress` added to `requirements.txt` (pinned 3.0.2) |
| MQ-02 | Removed dead `load_emails()` and `save_emails()` functions |
| MQ-03 | Global `@app.errorhandler(500)` added; bare `except Exception` in `/get-email` no longer leaks tracebacks |
| MQ-04 | All magic numbers centralised: `PREFETCH_WAIT_TIMEOUT`, `PREFETCH_RETRY_DELAY`, `TIMER_SECONDS`, `RATE_LIMIT_TTL`, `USER_AGENT_MAX_LENGTH`, `GET_EMAIL_INTERVAL` |
| MQ-05 | Feedback `maxlength` aligned: HTML `maxlength="300"` matches backend `DEFAULT_MAX_FEEDBACK_LENGTH = 300` |
| MQ-06 | Type hints added to all public functions and module-level variables |
| PERF-02 | `getParticleColor()` cached once per frame via `refreshParticleColor()` in `animate()` — eliminates per-particle layout thrash |
| PERF-03 | `SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT = 31536000` (1 year) for static asset caching |
| PERF-04 | `@import` removed from CSS; `<link rel="preconnect">` + `<link rel="stylesheet">` in HTML `<head>` — non-blocking font loading |
| DEVOPS-02 | All three requirements files pinned to exact versions |
| DEVOPS-03 | `.env.example` created documenting all env vars with placeholders |
| SCALE-04 | Confirmed game state is client-side only — no server persistence needed |

### 🔵 Low (4/4)

| ID | Fix |
|---|---|
| SEC-10 | `User-Agent` truncated to 512 chars before writing to disk |
| MQ-06 | Type hints added throughout |
| PERF-04 | Font loading non-blocking (same as above) |
| TEST-03 | Noted as future work — Playwright/Cypress infrastructure not added |

---

## Deferred Items (4)

These require infrastructure changes beyond the scope of in-place fixes:

| ID | Reason |
|---|---|
| MQ-01 | Module refactoring — separate PR to avoid compounding risk with 30 simultaneous bug fixes |
| SCALE-01 (full) | Redis for shared state — requires infrastructure; single-worker constraint documented |
| SCALE-03 | Async/task-queue — requires full framework rewrite; mitigated with `waitress` + `threaded=True` |
| TEST-03 | Playwright browser tests — requires CI infrastructure for a headless browser |

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **CSRF via custom header** — Flask-WTF was not added as a dependency to keep the stack lean. The `X-Requested-With` header approach is robust for pure JSON APIs since cross-origin forms cannot set custom headers.

2. **`waitress` over `gunicorn`** — waitress is cross-platform (works on Windows without Cygwin), making it consistent with the existing dev environment.

3. **`_RateLimiter` class** — a simple purpose-built class was preferred over `flask-limiter` to avoid adding a Redis dependency and keep the zero-infrastructure design intact.

4. **Prefetch thread isolation in tests** — the startup prefetch fires at import time, so all consensus engine tests patch `_prefetch_busy = False` immediately after import to prevent background threads from consuming mock side_effects.
